            <br>
            <p>
                
                The personal wealth of Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has fallen by nearly $7 billion in a few hours, following a selloff that sent the social-media giant’s stock plummeting about 5 percent on Monday.
                
                <img src="./images/markz.jpeg" class="bitcoin">
                
                Zuckerberg’s worth is down to $120.9 billion, dropping him below Bill Gates to No. 5 on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
                
                
                According to a Bloomberg report, he’s lost nearly $19 billion since September 13, when he was worth nearly $140 billion.
                
                Facebook’s share started falling after Wall Street Journal began publishing a series of stories based on a cache of internal documents on September 13.

                The reports revealed that Facebook knew about a wide range of problems with its products — such as Instagram’s harm to teenage girls’ mental health and misinformation about the January 6 Capitol riots — while downplaying the issues in public, according to a Bloomberg report.
                
                The Wall Street Journal reports have drawn the attention of government officials, and on Monday, the whistleblower revealed herself.
                
                In response to the Wall Street journal report, the social media giant has said that the issues concerning its products, including political polarisation, are complex and not caused by technology alone.
                
                The outage of the three popular social media platforms comes a day before one of its whistleblowers was all set to testify before a Congressional committee.
                
                On Monday, Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp platforms went down for a couple of hours. However, the services of these companies were restored on Tuesday.</p>

            <h1>YouTube lets you ‘continue watching’ unfinished videos on your smartphone</h1>
            <br>
            <p>YouTube is working on a new feature that seems to be slowly making its way for all users, as per a report
                by 9TO5Google.</p>
            <img src="./images/youtube.png" class="youtube">

            <p>The company is introducing the "continue watching" feature for both Android and iOS mobile devices to
                further enhance video watching continuity on YouTube across multiple devices.


                A similar feature is already available on the web version of YouTube which enables users to continue
                watching a video from where they last left off.

                Now YouTube is working on expanding the capabilities which will allow users to continue watching a video
                from where they left off, across multiple devices.

                What this will means is that when you are watching a YouTube video on your laptop and want to switch to
                a smartphone to continue watching the same video, you will be able to simply open the YouTube app to
                achieve the same.

                In the YouTube app, you will see the mini-player at the bottom, allowing you to open up the last YouTube
                video you never finished.

                It is important to note that in order for your smartphone's YouTube app to be able to sync your watched
                videos between devices, you will need to make sure you are logged into the same Google account on your
                computer, tablet, and smartphone.

                YouTube is one of the most popular social media apps in the world, which is home to a plethora of
                content across topics and genres.

                Once YouTube launches the "continue watching" feature, it will allow users to have a streamlined viewing
                experience while watching videos across different devices.

                Although the company has not yet confirmed when the feature will be available for all users, it should
                roll out soon as the continue watching" feature for YouTube on mobile is no longer in the beta phase.

            <h1>India’s crypto market grew 641% over past year, Chainalysis says</h1>
            <br>
            <p>NEW DELHI: India, Vietnam and Pakistan are helping to lead the expansion of cryptocurrency markets in
                central and southern Asia, according to Chainalysis.
                Market grew 641% over the past year and Pakistan’s 711%, a report from Chainalysis showed, using a
                metric that estimates the total cryptocurrency received by a country.
                <img src="./images/bitcoin.jpg" class="bitcoin">

                India has a 59% share of activity taking place on decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, with Pakistan
                at 33%, the report said, adding there’s been a significant increase in cryptocurrency-related
                entrepreneurship and venture capital investment in the region.
                “Large institutional-sized transfers above $10 million worth of cryptocurrency represent 42% of
                transactions sent from India-based addresses, versus 28% for Pakistan and 29% for Vietnam,” the report
                said.
                “Those numbers suggest that India’s cryptocurrency investors are part of larger, more sophisticated
                organizations.”
                The past year has seen a number of twists and turns for India's crypto market, including on the
                regulatory front, with some reports that the country might try to ban or otherwise restrict crypto.
                However, Chainalysis noted, more recently it looks as though the government may simply favor taxation.

            <h1>Byju’s valued at $18bn in $300 million fund-raise</h1>
            <p>
                BENGALURU: Byju’s has raised yet another big funding, $300 million, that values the firm at $18 billion.
                In the last round of funding earlier this year, the edtech company was valued at $16.5 billion.

                Data from business intelligence platform Tofler showed that Oxshott Capital Partners led the latest
                round, while existing investors Edelweiss, Verition Master Fund, IIFL, and Time Capital Advisors also
                participated.

                Byju’s did not comment on the latest fund-raise. The Bengaluru-based company is already the most valued
                privately-held company in India. Paytm follows at $16 billion.

                The Indian edtech space has turned red hot, especially since the pandemic, as children were forced to
                learn remotely. The country now has five unicorns (those valued at $1 billion or more), three of them
                emerging just this year - Eruditus, Vedantu, and Ugrad.

                86777204
                Online executive education startup Eruditus raised $650 million in August that valued the company at
                $3.2 billion, four times its Series D valuation of $780 million last year. Vedantu recently raised $100
                million in a Series E round that valued it at over $1 billion.

                Byju’s investors also include Tiger Global, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg’s foundation Chan
                Zuckerberg Initiative, Chinese conglomerate Tencent, Canadian pension firm CPPIB, Amsterdam-listed
                Prosus Ventures, sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority and PE major General Atlantic.

                Byju’s has been spending its funds primarily on acquisitions and international expansion. Earlier this
                year it bought Akash Educational Services for $1 billion to expand its offerings in competitive exam
                training.

                More recently, it bought Great Learning, a company that offers online higher education and upskilling
                courses, for $600 million.

                Byju’s plans to invest $1 billion in North America. Byju’s Future School, an online one-on-one live
                learning platform for math and coding was launched last month.

                The initiative uses 11,000 women teachers. The company has 100 million students on its free platform and
                7 million paid subscribers.

                Byju's has made a slew of acquisitions in recent years. The most recent was that of hte US-based K-12
                creative coding platform Tynker for $200 million (Rs 1,500 crore), part of an effort to consolidate its
                presence in the US.

                Tynker enables students of all ages to learn to code at home, school, or on the go. Prior to that it
                acquired US digital reading platform Epic, focused on kids 12 and under, for $500 million. It acquired
                US-based Osmo, a maker of educational games, for $120 million two years ago.

                Founder Byju Raveendran saw his wealth rise by 19% this year to Rs 24,300 crore, as per the latest IIFL
                Wealth Hurun India Rich List 2021.

            <h1>Elon Musk Shared Shiba Inu Puppy Floki's Photo and Dogecoin Value Spiked</h1>
            <br>
            <img src="./images/elonmusk.jpg" class="bitcoin">
            <p>Elon Musk is not done posting his new pupper content – or involuntarily affecting the prices of cryptocurrency Dogecoin. Dogecoin started as a joke. In early 2021, however, the joke appears to have turned on those who didn’t take the meme cryptocurrency seriously. The meme-cryptocurrency Elon Musk wouldn’t stop tweeting about reached an all-time high in mid-April, crossing 10 cents for the first time. his is the highest-ever for the cryptocurrency, and the result of a semi-ironic movement that’s involved thousands of buyers, tens of thousands of online posters and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk. In early January, each token was worth less than one cent. In late January, when both the GameStop and DogeCoin movements hit their stride, the value of DogeCoin shot up to 7.5 cents, well over a 10-magnification, before sliding down to 2.5 cents. While Musk has consistently stopped tweeting about the cryptocurrency, (which has also been met with a lot of backlash for people who blame Musk for investing their money in it, only to see it no longer rise) Musk is however, posting puppy content on Twitter. Early on Monday morning, Musk posted another photo of Floki, his newest Shiba Inu puppy.

               <img src="./images/dog.jpeg" class="bitcoin">

                The pupper appears to be in the seat of a car, like Musk was taking it along for a drive. While Floki is going somewhere, so were cryptocurrency prices soon after Musk’s tweet. Following Musk’s tweet at 7:11 AM IST (GMT +5:30), Dogecoin recorded a minor jump in value staring 7:13 AM before dipping again fifteen minutes later, shows Coindesk data. The current value of the cryptocurrency Dogecoin is $0.21 at the time of writing this at 10:02 AM.
                
                
                While Dogecoin’s spike was minor, the cryptocurrency named specifically after Floki, Floki, jumped drastically following Musk’s tweet.
                
                
                Floki Inu describes itself as ‘the new community-owned meme coin.’ The description of the coin reads, ‘Floki Inu is one brave puppy. A new crypto coin birthed by fans & members of the Shiba Inu community. Floki Inu is Elon Musk’s very own shiba inu and he’s hungry for outer-space treats! He’s hyper-deflationary and built to reward you, so more Floki Inu coins are added to your wallet with each transaction. This lil puppy is a space explorer – simply love, pet, and watch your Floki Inu fly to Mars!’
                
                
                The website for Floki Inu also says currently, there are ‘40,000+’ holders of the cryptocurrency token: something the site also says is rewarded. “FLOKI has been designed to be a deflationary token which rewards you simply for holding!” explains the official website for the cryptocurrency. The statistics also claims that “Floki Inu has a total circulating supply of 9.21T $FLOKI across the ETH & BSC chain combined and has a total circulating market cap of $314.81M across the ETH and BSC chains.” The icon for the token is the face of a Shiba Inu wearing a small viking helmet.</p>

                <h1>Russian film crew blasts off to shoot world's first movie in space</h1>
            <br>
            <p>A Russian crew of two cosmonauts, a movie director and an actress blasted off for the International Space
                Station (ISS) on Tuesday to shoot the first movie in space, the latest twist in decades of Russia-U.S.
                space rivalry.

                <img src="./images/russia.jpeg" class="bitcoin">

                The Soyuz MS-19 spacecraft is set to dock at 1212 GMT at the station, which orbits Earth at an altitude
                of around 220 miles (354 km).

                Russian state media provided blanket and patriotic coverage in the run-up, with a countdown clock
                running on Channel One and news anchors framing the development as a significant breakthrough by Russia
                that the rest of the world is watching closely.

                The fanfare contrasted with the mixed fortunes of Russia's own space industry which has in recent years
                been dogged by delays, accidents and corruption scandals as U.S.-based private firms backed by rich
                businessmen have developed new spaceships.

                The 12-day Russian mission follows the launch of the first all-civilian crew aboard a rocket and capsule
                developed by SpaceX, which was founded by businessman Elon Musk.

                The Russian mission is designed to get in first before a Hollywood project announced earlier this year
                by actor Tom Cruise together with NASA and SpaceX.


                Russia, first as the Soviet Union, and the United States have competed fiercely to reach various space
                exploration milestones: Russia launched the first satellite and put the first man and woman in space,
                but NASA beat it to the Moon landing.

                The Russian movie titled "The challenge" focuses on a story of a doctor, portrayed by actress Yulia
                Peresild, who is asked to travel to the space station to save a cosmonaut's life. Cosmonaut crew members
                are also set to appear in the film.

                Director Klim Shipenko, whose height of 1.9 metres (6 feet 2 inches) makes the flight in a small capsule
                especially challenging, has already said he was looking forward to a Mars-based sequel.

                Reflecting the Soviet roots of Russia's space industry, the crew will be launched from the Baikonur
                cosmodrome in the steppes of Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia. Russia leases the

                Russia's own, newer Vostochny cosmodrome is years away from serving manned aircraft, officials say.

            <p>Windows 11 is now available for download on your PC. Microsoft has released the software upgrade starting
                October 5 in each time zone that eligible machines have begun to receive in most parts of the world. If
                you are in India, you can quickly go to the Windows Update settings on your machine to check if Windows
                11 is available now. But keep in mind your PC should be compatible. The launch of the Windows 11-powered
                PCs and laptops is still happening on October 5, which is later today.

                "We're pumped to be launching Windows 11; the entire user experience brings you closer to what you love,
                empowers you to produce and inspires you to create. Windows 11 provides a sense of calm and openness. It
                gives you a place that feels like home. It's secure and everything is designed to be centered around
                you," said Panos Panay, chief product officer for Windows and Devices at Microsoft.

                Microsoft said only existing PCs will be eligible for a free Windows 11 upgrade, but, according to the
                system requirements for the new software, only the new hardware will be eligible. This rules out
                hundreds of PCs that run Windows 10 just fine, but because they have an outdated processor, Windows 11
                will not support them. Panay is optimistic all Windows 10 devices with a compatible CPU will "be offered
                the upgrade to Windows 11 by mid-2022."


                If you are unsure about whether your PC meets the system requirements for Windows 11, you can download
                the PC Health Check app from the Microsoft website. The tool -- which was re-released recently because
                the first time it was released it was found misguiding its users -- will tell you in detail why your PC
                is or is not supported by Windows 11.

                The most important requirement for Windows 11 compatibility is TPM 2.0, which is a security standard
                that Microsoft needs to be enabled on your CPU. Some old CPUs support this but it is usually disabled by
                default. Brands such as Asus and Acer began rolling out BIOS updates to enable TPM 2.0 on eligible CPUs
                recently, so it is possible that your PC will support Windows 11 if the CPU is not too old.

                Windows 11 is free to upgrade for genuine Windows 10 users. But if you are using, say, Windows 7 or
                previous versions, you may need to buy Windows 11. However, there are several workarounds on the
                internet on how to get Windows 10 for free, which means Windows 11 will also be free once you get
                Windows 10. Those buying new PCs from brands such as HP, Dell, Lenovo, Asus, Acer, and Samsung will get
                Windows 11 pre-loaded.

                The recently launched Xiaomi and Realme laptops, such as Mi NoteBook Ultra, Mi NoteBook Pro, and Realme
                Book Slim, are all eligible for Windows 11 upgrade. So, if you bought one of these recently, you can
                download Windows 11 right away. Make sure you backup your data safely before you start the update
                process. Also, a strong internet connection is required for it.
